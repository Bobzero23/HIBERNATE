START WITH H2 DATABASE
+ after putting the dependencies
+ in application.properties you gonna have to enable and configure it
+ run the app and go to the online h2-console endpoint and see if the database is working
+ create the data.sql file and there you will initialize the database i.e tables and e.t.c
    Note: there on the website you can run your own queries
    Note: the other thing is better to insert your columns in data.sql instead of querying them online
    because when you query them online and as long as you restart the server it deletes everything

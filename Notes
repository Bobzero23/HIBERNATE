START WITH H2 DATABASE
+ after putting the dependencies
+ in application.properties you gonna have to enable and configure it
+ run the app and go to the online h2-console endpoint and see if the database is working
+ create the data.sql file and there you will initialize the database i.e tables and e.t.c
    Note: there on the website you can run your own queries
    Note: the other thing is better to insert your columns in data.sql instead of querying them online
    because when you query them online and as long as you restart the server it deletes everything

START WITH SPRING JDBC
+ Create a model(entity) class (@Data, @AllArgsConstructor, @NoArgsConstructor)
+ Create a new class call it blahBlahDao
+ Make the connection with database using JdbcTemplate (Autowire it or use constructor)
+ use the jdbc to write query and map it with the model class
+ At this point you must have been created the table and insert the values inside the data.sql
+ After that simply implement the CommandLineRunner and use the @Slf4J to get the log instance
+ then while implementing the methods of CommandLineRunner interface use the logger so we can see
    the table
+ The table must be coming from the Model class which you just autowire it up there
** I know is kinda mess
